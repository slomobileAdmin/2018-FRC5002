Monday Meeting 

No mentor meetings scheduled between now and first build.
We need to see what robot parts are available and setup
workstations and tools prior to build.  
About 4 hours work for 2 people.

Recommend digging through stuff while we talk tonight.
See what we have, create list of what we need right now, and long term.

Really confused about what we are allowed to do in the space.
If we need to protect the floor, we need firm information about 
what is and isn't allowed.  Can we work in the area with chairs? 
Need answer to 'where can we drive the bot', now.
Do mentors have authority to rearrange the shop to optimize for FRC or 
must the space be preserved as is for classes etc?

We need work surfaces!
Benches not deep enough for full robot, inhibits communication and teamwork, 
and are full of tools.  We need a few wide tables(~3'x4') access on all sides.
Cannot do build days without that.  
If we cant have tables, need to cancel build day.

A few tall work stools in tool room would help also.  At least 1 with solid feet
others can have wheels.
