3.6.1

A PLAYER STATION is one (1) of three (3) assigned positions in an ALLIANCE WALL from where a
DRIVE TEAM operates their ROBOT. Each PLAYER STATION is made from a 3 ft. (~91 cm) tall diamond
plate panel base topped with a 3 ft. 6 in. (~107 cm) tall transparent plastic panel. An aluminum shelf is
attached to each PLAYER STATION to support the DRIVE TEAM’S OPERATOR CONSOLE. The shelf is
5 ft. 9 in. (~175 cm) wide and 1 ft. (~30 cm) deep. There is a 4 ft. 6 in. (~137 cm) long by 2 in. (nominal)
wide strip of hook-and-loop tape (“loop” side) along the center of the support shelf that may be used to
secure the OPERATOR CONSOLE to the shelf.
Each PLAYER STATION contains the following components for Teams:
• One Ethernet Cable: attaches to the Ethernet port of the OPERATOR CONSOLE and
provides connectivity to the FIELD Management System.
• One 120VAC NEMA 5-15R power outlet: located on each PLAYER STATION shelf and
protected by its own 2-Amp circuit breaker. It can be used to power the OPERATOR
CONSOLE. DRIVE TEAMS are responsible for monitoring their power consumption as a
tripped breaker in the outlet does not constitute an ARCADE fault.
• One Emergency Stop (E-Stop) button: located on the left side of the PLAYER STATION shelf
and should be used to deactivate a ROBOT in an emergency.
• One Team sign: displays the Team number and located at the top of each PLAYER
STATION.
• One Team LED: indicates ALLIANCE color, ROBOT status, and E-Stop status and centered
at the top of each PLAYER STATION. Team LED states include:
− Solid: indicates that the ROBOT is connected and enabled. This will only happen during a
MATCH.
− Blinking: indicates that either the Field Management System is preset for the MATCH or it’s
during a MATCH and the corresponding ROBOT has lost connectivity.
− Off: indicates that the MATCH has not started yet, but the ROBOT is linked and disabled. −
If the amber LED is on, the E-stop button has been pressed.
• One Timer (in the PORTAL adjacent to PLAYER STATION 1): displays the official time
remaining in AUTO, TELEOP, and TIMEOUTS and marked with white tape along the bottom
edge.
• Field Management System hardware and wiring: mostly located below the center PLAYER
STATION shelf.

3.10 The FIELD Management System
The FIELD Management System (FMS) is the electronics core responsible for controlling the FIRST
Robotics Competition playing field. The FMS encompasses all field electronics, including the computers,
REFEREE touchscreens, wireless access point, sensors, stack lights, E-Stops, etc.
When a DRIVE TEAM connects the Ethernet cable from their assigned PLAYER STATION to their
OPERATOR CONSOLE, the Driver Station software on the OPERATOR CONSOLE computer will begin
to communicate with the Field Management System (FMS). Once connected to FMS, the only open ports
available are described in Table 3-3.
Table 3-3: Open FMS Ports
Port Designation Bi-directional?
UDP/TCP 1180-1190
Camera data from the roboRIO to the Driver
Station (DS) when the camera is connected
the roboRIO via USB
Yes
TCP 1735 SmartDashboard Yes
UDP 1130 Dashboard-to-ROBOT control data Yes
UDP 1140 ROBOT-to-Dashboard status data Yes
HTTP 80 Camera connected via switch on the ROBOT Yes
HTTP 443 Camera connected via switch on the ROBOT Yes
UDP/TCP 554 Real-Time Streaming Protocol for h.264
camera streaming Yes
UDP/TCP 5800-5810 Team Use Yes


Teams may use these ports as they wish if they do not employ them as outlined above (e.g. TCP 1180
can be used to pass data back and forth between the ROBOT and the Driver Station software if the Team
chooses not to use the camera on USB). Note that ROBOT code cannot be deployed while connected to
the FMS. Additional information about the FMS may be found in the FMS Whitepaper.
The FMS provides the ALLIANCE color assigned to each PLATE to the Driver Station software.
Immediately following the assignment of PLATE color prior to the start of AUTO. Specific details on the
format of the data can be found on the 2018 FRC Control System website.
While FMS does provide the ALLIANCE PLATE color to each team’s
Driver Station, teams must write the necessary ROBOT code to make
use of the information during a MATCH.

FMS alerts participants to milestones in the MATCH using audio cues. Please note that audio cues are
intended to be a courtesy to participants and not intended as official MATCH markers. If there is a
discrepancy between an audio cue and the FIELD timers, the FIELD timers are the authority.
• MATCH Start & PLATES randomized: “Startup Sound”
• AUTO Start: “Cavalry Charge”
• T=0 for AUTO: Buzzer
• Start of TELEOP: Three (3) Bells
• T-30 seconds in TELEOP: Train Whistle
• T=0 for TELEOP/MATCH end: Buzzer
• MATCH stopped: Foghorn
• POWER UP activated: “Linear Popping"

C09. Plug in to/be in your PLAYER STATION. The OPERATOR CONSOLE must be used in the
PLAYER STATION to which the Team is assigned, as indicated on the Team sign.
Violation: The MATCH will not start until the situation is corrected. If during a MATCH, DISABLED.
One intent of C09 is to prevent unsafe situations where long tethers to
OPERATOR CONSOLE devices increase tripping hazards as the
operator moves about the ALLIANCE STATION. In the interest of
avoiding nuisance penalties associated with an operator stepping outside
of a prescribed area, we prefer to offer a general guideline as to what it
means to use the OPERATOR CONSOLE in the ALLIANCE STATION.
Provided the operator is within close proximity of their PLAYER
STATION, there will be no repercussions. However, if an operator is
located more than approximately ½ PLAYER STATION width away from
their own PLAYER STATION, that would be considered a violation of
C09.

G03. Know your DRIVE TEAM positions. Prior to the start of the MATCH, DRIVE TEAMS must be
positioned as follows:
A. DRIVERS and COACHES must be in their ALLIANCE STATION and behind the
STARTING LINE
B. HUMAN PLAYERS must be behind the STARTING LINE and either in their
ALLIANCE STATION or one of their ALLIANCE PORTALS
C. TECHNICIANS must be in their designated area outside the ALLIANCE STATION
and PORTALS.
Violation: MATCH will not start until the situation is corrected.
The specific location for the TECHNICIAN to stand during a MATCH may
vary by event due to space restrictions around the FIELD. In general,
TECHNICIANS are located with their Team’s ROBOT cart and within
close proximity to the FIELD.



8.10 OPERATOR CONSOLE
R97. The Driver Station software provided on the National Instruments website is the only application
permitted to specify and communicate the operating mode (i.e. Autonomous/Teleoperated) and
operating state (Enable/Disable) to the ROBOT. The Driver Station software must be revision
18.0 or newer.
Teams are permitted to use a portable computing device of their choice
(laptop computer, tablet, etc.) to host the DRIVER Station software while
participating in competition MATCHES.
R98. The OPERATOR CONSOLE, the set of COMPONENTS and MECHANISMS used by the
DRIVERS and/or HUMAN PLAYER to relay commands to the ROBOT, must include a graphic
display to present the Driver Station diagnostic information. It must be positioned within the
OPERATOR CONSOLE so that the screen display can be clearly seen during Inspection and in a
MATCH.
R99. Devices hosting the Driver Station software must only interface with the Field Management
System (FMS) via the Ethernet cable provided at the PLAYER STATION (e.g. not through a
switch). Teams may connect the FMS Ethernet cable to their Driver Station device directly via an
Ethernet pigtail, or with a single-port Ethernet converter (e.g. docking station, USB-Ethernet
converter, Thunderbolt-Ethernet converter, etc.). The Ethernet port on the OPERATOR
CONSOLE must be easily and quickly accessible.
Teams are strongly encouraged to use pigtails on the Ethernet port used
to connect to the FMS. Such pigtails will reduce wear and tear on the
device’s port and, with proper strain relief employed, will protect the port
from accidental damage.
R100. The OPERATOR CONSOLE must not
A. be longer than 60 in. (~152 cm)
B. be deeper than 14 in. (~35 cm) (excluding any items that are held or worn by the
DRIVERS during the MATCH)
C. extend more than 6 ft. 6 in. (~198 cm) above the floor
D. attach to the ARCADE (except as permitted by G19)
There is a 54 in. (~137 cm) long by 2 in. (nominal) wide strip of hookand-loop
tape (“loop” side) along the center of the PLAYER STATION
support shelf that should be used to secure the OPERATOR CONSOLE
to the shelf, per G19. See Section 3.6.1 PLAYER STATION for details.
Please note that while there is no hard weight limit, OPERATOR
CONSOLES that weigh more than 30 lbs. (~13 kg.) will invite extra
scrutiny as they are likely to present unsafe circumstances.
R101. Other than the system provided by the ARCADE, no other form of wireless communications shall
be used to communicate to, from, or within the OPERATOR CONSOLE.
Examples of prohibited wireless systems include, but are not limited to,
active wireless network cards and Bluetooth devices. For the case of the
FIRST Robotics Competition, a motion sensing input device (e.g.
Microsoft Kinect) is not considered wireless communication and is
allowed.
R102. OPERATOR CONSOLES shall not be made using hazardous materials, be unsafe, cause an
unsafe condition, or interfere with other DRIVE TEAMS or the operation of other ROBOTS.

ALLIANCE Leads are assigned to PLAYER STATION 2, the first picks are assigned to their left in
PLAYER STATION 1, and second picks are assigned to the ALLIANCE Lead’s right in PLAYER
STATION 3. If a BACKUP TEAM is in play, they will be assigned to the PLAYER STATION that was
assigned to the DRIVE TEAM they’re replacing. Teams cannot change assignments.

For Quarterfinal MATCHES, the higher seeded ALLIANCE is assigned to the Red ALLIANCE. Beyond the
Quarterfinal MATCHES, the ALLIANCE on the top of each MATCH in Figure 10-2 are assigned to the
Red ALLIANCE, regardless of whether they are the higher seeded ALLIANCE in that particular MATCH.

If a DRIVE TEAM needs clarification on a ruling or score, per C08, one (1) pre-college student from that
DRIVE TEAM should address the Head REFEREE after the ARCADE Reset Signal (e.g. LED lights turn
green). A DRIVE TEAM member signals their desire to speak with the Head REFEREE by standing in the
corresponding Red or Blue Question Box, which are located on the floor near each end of the scoring
table. Depending on timing, the Head REFEREE may postpone any requested discussion until the end of
the subsequent MATCH as necessary.
